### The largest Vermeer exhibition ever

Rijksmuseum announced from 10 February to 4 June 2023 there will be the largest Vermeer [exhibition](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/whats-on/exhibitions/vermeer) ever. It collects 28 out of 35 paintings all over the world.

200,000 were sold already before March. However the visitors weren't satisfied with it. Rijksmuseum decided to sell another 200,000 tickets by extending the timeslots in the evening so that more visitors can attend. They promised to give an update on March 6th.

I knew this exhibition very late, hopefully I catch up on the second round of sale. I wrote a parser to keep track on the updates of the website.

On March 6th, around noon, my parser did notify me that there's an update and the ticket was started to sell, suddenly the website went down, I think they never thought that a museum website can attact so much traffic at once, even more than a concert scale. Even though the parser helped me to get notified, I was still not able to buy the ticket, what an unfortunate story.

Nevertheless, my lucky flatmate told me she randomly refreshed the website and got the ticekts the other day! What a story! So eventually I still visited the exhibition :)

Although it seems to be an useless parser, let's find a place to bury it, I think here is it!
